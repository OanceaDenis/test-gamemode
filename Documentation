	An important rule of PAWN is that public functions must always be forwarded, otherwise you will receive warnings from the 
compiler. To forward, copy the function's prototype (followed by a semi-colon) and add a 'forward' keyword in front of it.
	Public functions cannot return strings. Instead, you have to call your own function. 
	Parameters in functions are locally declared.
	As written in one of Slice's tutorials, stop the abuse of stocks. It is barely needed. Stocks should be for internal use 
(includes) and that is only when the function or variable may not be used. Use 'static stock'.
	Strings must end with a null character ('\0', called NUL in ASCII). That tells the compiler where the strings ends, so 
functions like 'strlen' may be used. Also, a common mistake is to use 'MAX_PLAYER_NAME' instead of 'MAX_PLAYER_NAME +1' - you have
to give it a one cell space for the null character.
