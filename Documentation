	An important rule of PAWN is that public functions must always be forwarded, otherwise you will receive warnings from the 
compiler. To forward, copy the function's prototype (followed by a semi-colon) and add a 'forward' keyword in front of it.
	Public functions cannot return strings. Instead, you have to call your own function. 
	Parameters in functions are locally declared.
